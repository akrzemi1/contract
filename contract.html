<h1>What do we need?</h1>

<p>The 'features' we describe here can be collectively called <em>value constraints.</em> We want to use them to put some <em>constraints</em> into the program that cannot be handled by the current C++ type system.</p>
<h2>Specify function's domain</h2>
<p>The problem goes back to mathematics. Certain functions are well defined only for a subset of values of the input type. for instance a square root over real numbers is not defined for negative numbers. What does it mean for a function in a programming language like C++ that it is not defined? Currently there are two approaches. One is to detect the value of the parameter(s) that the function should not be prepared for and execute a different logic: returning a special value, throwing an exception, etc. Using our example with a square root, a corresponding function <code>sqrt()</code> could be defined as follows:</p>
