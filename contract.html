<h2>Preconditions</h2>
<p>A precondition is part of function's interface. A function is guranteed to work correctly only if its precondition is satisfied upon the call. Function caller must encure that a precondition holds before calling the function. Function's implementer can assume that the precondition holds, and need not consider what happens if the precondition doesn't hold.</p>
